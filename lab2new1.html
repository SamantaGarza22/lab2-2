    <head2><strong><em>A little about me</em></strong></head2>
    <p> As a kid i always enjoyed the good experience that i would get from
        shopping with my mother and i also enjoyed alot the visuals of the stores
        as i grow up i realized that i had the intrige of what was behind the creation
        of those posters. Moving to another country help me recognize a personal
        desing style that is a combination of my culture and its
        adaptation of new enviroments. When i was eighteen i stared my journey by selling
        product photography sessions and imideatly got a huge
        list of clients who wanted to work with me by the age of
        nineteen i was taking care of the social media of 
        alkot of local bussiness in Mexico, On 2021 i had the
        creative direction for a local project in Mexico.
